# Code sections
(1) Dataset tools:
  In this section, one can find tools for image enhancement. Specifically, image sharpenning (Done by unsharp masking algorithm [1]).
  In addition, few functions for data augmentation and the arrangmenet of the data in folders can be found in this section.


(2) Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation:
  The model is a combination of DINOv2 (Encoder) and SegFormer (Decoder) for semantic segmentation.

# Using the code
(1) Using the dataset tools is function-dependent.
Each function has a usage example, showing how to use it.

(2) Using the Model.



**In this project, the dataset was of RAVIR [2] and was supposed to improve SegRAVIR [3] model results.
